 *        data: array of bytes to send over serial from radio module
 *        buffer: place to hold the message. Must be 4 bytes longer than message
 *        size: size of the data which is being sent
 * Returns: the length of the message as an int.
 * Note: the maximum size message the radio can send theoretically is 0xF3 or 243 bytes
 * (including the package bytes its 0xF6 or 246) but testing shows reliability starts
 * dropping around 140 bytes so size messages accordingly.
