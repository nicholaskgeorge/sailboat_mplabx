# sailboat_mplabx
This github repository contains runnable code for controlling each subsystem of the autonomous sailboat. 

## Project Overview

The goal of our research is to develop a low-cost autonomous sailboat as a new candidate for autonomousmonitoring the oceans. The system design contains one Atmel SAM-E70 board.  We divided the whole embedded system into five subsystems:  sensor system, datalogging system, power system, communication system, and actuator system. Each subsystem contains relatedelectronic devices and corresponding peripherals on the board. The design and implementation of the embedded system are presented in the report [Designing the Embedded System of an Autonomous Sailboat](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mgmqvyhkvwvr).

## System Architecture

The system architecture of the boat is below.
